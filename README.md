# Super Mario Keys

### This project intends to extrapolate input keys using videos of Super Mario Brothers videos on Youtube.

Using these videos, we will break down the research into two main components: object detection to determine velocity of various obstacles, and object detection to determine where mario is on the screen. As the model determines velocity and the mapping of Mario a tracing is created to show where Mario moved throughout the video. This tracing will then using a similar technique to gesuture control which will then determine the keys pressed throughout the video.
